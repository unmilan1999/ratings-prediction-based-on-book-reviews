# ratings-prediction-based-on-book-reviews

Reviews are a good way to judge the quality of any product, whether it's books, clothes, technology, or anything else. Reader connection and engagement will be encouraged by book reviews, whether they be left on Amazon, Goodreads, or social media. Readers must determine whether or not other readers are enjoying the book.

To study this, we worked with a challenging dataset consisting reviews from the Goodreads book review website, and a variety of attributes describing the items and we predicted review rating which ranges from 1 to 5.
